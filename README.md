# sorting-visualizer
Visualize the common sorting algorithms with smooth animations. Learn about them in the site as well, with external resources to learn more. Bootstrapped from React create-react-app. <br/>
The buttons in the upper center of the page allow for the animations to occur. Click on of them to check it out! Also, you can adjsut the speed of the animations and the number of bars at the top of the page for better visualization of the algorithms. <br/>
To stop the animation, click the stop button on the top left. The (i) button on the top left allows you to learn more about the algorithms. I've provided some pseudocode on the site as well if you'd like to check that out!
